//in java we can achieve multithreading in two ways

//01. by extends Thread class
//02. by implements Runnable interface


life cycle of thread 
01 new 
02 Runnable
03 Running 
04 Non-Running (Blocked by thread schedular)
05 Terminated

new is a state when our thread is newlly created.

Runnable is a state when we called start() method and our method any time ready to serve.

Running is a state when our thread is Running.

Non-blocking is a state when our thread is taking time to load contant then thread schedular put thread to non-blocking area to run another thread once it's completed then again our method went in running state after complete code run it will terminated.

Terminated is a state when our method completed its task and ready to terminated.


Thread class contructors 

01) Thread();
02) Thread(String name);
03) Thread(Runnable r);
04) Thread(Runnable r, String name);
05) Thread(ThreadGroup g)

Thread Class Methods
01) obj.getId() - it returns thread ID (Every thread has unique id).
02) obj.getName() - it returns thread name (Which is given by us through constructor).
